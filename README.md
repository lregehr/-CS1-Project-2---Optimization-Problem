# -CS1-Project-2---Optimization-Problem
This project addresses the facility location problem on 128 U.S. cities. It implements a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of facilities needed to cover every city within a specified radius. The program reads geographic data, applies the algorithm, and formats the solution for visualization.
